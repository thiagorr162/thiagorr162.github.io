I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in Brazil. I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA), with research focused on boosting methods and concentration of measure in machine learning. I also hold a Master’s and a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from the University of São Paulo (ICMC-USP).

I am part of the [Statistical Machine Learning Lab (SMALL-UFSCar)](https://small-research.github.io/website/), where we explore statistical and machine learning methods to address real-world problems across different areas.
