I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at the Federal University of São Carlos (UFSCar) in Brazil. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the Institute for Pure and Applied Mathematics (IMPA) in Rio de Janeiro, focusing on boosting methods and concentration of measure in machine learning. I also earned my M.Sc. and Bachelor's degrees in Mathematics from the Universidade de São Paulo (ICMC-USP).
